# Git Basics Cheatsheet

This is a quick reference guide for the most commonly used Git commands. You can bookmark this page and use it whenever you need a reminder or are learning Git.

## Remote Repository Commands

- **Clone a repository:**
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
  ```
  This copies a remote repository to your local machine.

- **Push changes to the remote repository:**
  ```
  git push
  ```
  or
  ```
  git push origin main
  ```
  Both commands upload your local commits to the remote repository. The second is more explicit about pushing the `main` branch.

## Workflow Commands

- **Stage files for commit:**
  ```
  git add .
  ```
  This stages all modified and new files in the current directory for the next commit.

- **Commit staged files with a message:**
  ```
  git commit -m "A message describing your changes"
  ```
  This creates a new commit containing the staged changes along with a descriptive message.

## Checking Status and History

- **Check the current status of your working directory and staging area:**
  ```
  git status
  ```
  Shows which files are staged, modified, or untracked.

- **View the commit history:**
  ```
  git log
  ```
  Displays a list of commits, including author, date, and commit messages.

## Basic Git Command Syntax

Git commands usually follow this pattern:

```
git | action | destination
```

Examples:

- `git add .` — here `add` is the action, and `.` means all files in the current directory.
- `git commit -m "message"` — `commit -m` is the action with a message describing the changes.
- `git status` — no destination is needed for this action.

Familiarizing yourself with these commands will make your Git workflow smoother and more efficient!
